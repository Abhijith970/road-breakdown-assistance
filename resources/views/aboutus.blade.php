        Many a time, people face issues regarding breakdown of their vehicles at a road side. One of the reasons mentioned below causes this hassle. 
        <ul>
            <li>  Worn-out vehicle battery</li>
            <li>   Damaged wheels and tyres </li>
            <li>  Lost keys</li>
            <li>  Failing of the starter motor </li>
            <li>  Deterioration of the HT leads </li>
        </ul>
       
        Whatever the reason may be, when people faced such a situation, it is very difficult to find mechanics from nearby areas and it will take much more time and cost.
